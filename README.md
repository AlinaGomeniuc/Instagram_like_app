  * List should contain at least 30 elements.
  * Implement list with multiple columns

- Pick up an architecture which fits the best your project and refactor your code base to selected architecture. Your codebase should be refactored to follow idiomatic representation of selected architecture. You should follow principles of "Clean Architectures" https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html and "Clean code" https://www.investigatii.md/uploads/resurse/Clean_Code.pdf.


## Laboratory nr.4
